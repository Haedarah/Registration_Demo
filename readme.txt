1. Go to "https://remix.ethereum.org/"
2. Inside "contracts" folder, create a new file, you can call it "Demo.sol"
3. Paste the contract there.
4. Compile and deploy the contract on "Remix VM - Sepolia fork".
5. Try interacting with the different buttons using different accounts from the list that Remix provide you.
